    EC numbers were not developed by KEGG.  EC stands for <see href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_Commission_number">Enzyme Commission</see>, 
    which is a numerical classification scheme for enzymes, based on the chemical reactions that they catalyze.  Since 2003, KEGG has used 
    <token>OrthologyDbPrefix</token> numbers to identify enzymes by their gene in the <token>OrthologyDbLink</token> database, 
    rather than the relatively imprecise EC numbers; however, the KEGG API still permits EC numbers to be used when querying for enzyme data.
